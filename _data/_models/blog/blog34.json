Here we&rsquo;ve broken down what to avoid and ways to enjoy all the city has to offer like a true local.</p>\n<p><strong>Yellow taxis.</strong> Yes, we know they&rsquo;re the first thing that pops into your head when you imagine Manhattan, but the truth is, they&rsquo;re a bit pricey and there&rsquo;s usually traffic. Yellow cab fares start at $2.50, and each ⅕ mile or minute is an additional 50 cents. That doesn&rsquo;t include weekday surcharges during rush hour and the tip. We suggest you opt for the real NYC experience by hopping on the subway. It&rsquo;s quicker, cheaper and you get to people watch. The New Yorker Hotel is located right next to the main intercity railroad station, Penn Station. <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir/The+New+Yorker+A+Wyndham+Hotel,+481+8th+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10001,+USA/Penn+Station,+New+York,+NY,+United+States/@40.751649,-73.9957664,17z/am=t/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c259ade9128e5f:0x2276df1fe19f85bc!2m2!1d-73.9936052!2d40.752722!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c259ae15b2adcb:0x7955420634fd7eba!2m2!1d-73.993519!2d40.750568\">In one minute</a>, you&rsquo;re in the station connected to the entire city. Just cross 8th Avenue to 34th to enter the historic station. Metro fare runs $2.75.</p>\n<p><strong>Empire State Building.</strong> There are better options out there for visitors. The Empire State Building&rsquo;s lines are long, observation decks are cramped and tickets are on the steep side. Instead, check out the <a href=\"https://www.topoftherocknyc.com/\">Top of the Rock</a> at Rockefeller Center. Indoor and outdoor viewing decks allow panoramic views of the city and the lines move quicker than at the Empire State Building -- which you get an absolutely great view of from the Top of the Rock! Tickets run $28-34. Another option is the <a href=\"http://www.nyharborparks.org/visit/brhe.html\">Brooklyn Heights Promenade in Brooklyn</a>, which offers views of the East River and Manhattan for free. You may recognize the elevated walkway in scenes from Annie Hall. The subway brings you there on the blue C train to Euclid Ave., then get off at High Street - Brooklyn Bridge Station. A 12-minute walk down Henry Street toward Pierrepont Street will get you there.

Over the years, Little Italy has lost its homey charm and become somewhat of a theme park. If you&rsquo;re after the Italian-American food experience, then we recommend you head over to <a href=\"http://www.arthuravenuebronx.com/\">Arthur Avenue in the Bronx</a>. Located in the Belmont section of the Bronx, Arthur Avenue is filled with all the Italian groceries and restaurants you desire. It&rsquo;s a bit far, but you&rsquo;ll be happy you checked it out. Check out the Subway route from The New Yorker Hotel <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir/The+New+Yorker+A+Wyndham+Hotel,+481+8th+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10001,+USA/Arthur+Ave,+Bronx,+NY,+USA/@40.800697,-74.0103135,12z/am=t/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c259ade9128e5f:0x2276df1fe19f85bc!2m2!1d-73.9936052!2d40.752722!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2f47d4a49f21f:0xc2511c6a544ed303!2m2!1d-73.8903571!2d40.8503613!5i2\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Statue of Liberty.</strong> We&rsquo;re by no means saying the Statue of Liberty is overrated, but we think the best view of Lady Liberty is from <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Battery+Park/@40.7032815,-74.0192219,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a12f88ba2ad:0xbe70465e98439c12!8m2!3d40.7032775!4d-74.0170279\">The Battery</a> also known at Battery Park. This way, you avoid lines, a $18.50 ferry ride and a let-down if there&rsquo;s crummy weather. Additionally, access to the statue&rsquo;s crown is usually sold out months in advance, as just 300 visitors are allowed at the top per day. Instead, get lunch to go and enjoy the site from <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Battery+Park/@40.7032815,-74.0192219,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a12f88ba2ad:0xbe70465e98439c12!8m2!3d40.7032775!4d-74.0170279\">Battery Park</a>. Total walking and subway time is about half an hour from The New Yorker Hotel. Check out the route <a href=\"https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir/The+New+Yorker+A+Wyndham+Hotel,+481+8th+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10001,+USA/Battery+Park,+New+York,+NY,+United+States/@40.7279553,-74.0384184,13z/am=t/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c259ade9128e5f:0x2276df1fe19f85bc!2m2!1d-73.9936052!2d40.752722!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a126480c6e5:0x6a6ebc63ffaa4d8f!2m2!1d-74.0168586!2d40.7024946!5i2\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sightseeing cruises.</strong> Tickets to sightseeing cruises usually run pretty steep, and New Yorkers know that the Staten Island Ferry is free and offers just about the same views (it also runs 24/7!). The ferries are usually crowded with tourists fighting over airspace to take the best photo. Check out the skyline like a local and go on the <a href=\"http://www.siferry.com/\">Staten Island Ferry</a> or the <a href=\"https://govisland.com/info\">Governors Island Ferry</a> ($2 round trip), which has many points of departure you can view <a href=\"https://govisland.com/info/ferry\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
