We&rsquo;ve covered five of our favorite attractions and events so you can spend less time researching and more time celebrating.</p>\n<h4>1. Randall&rsquo;s Island Haunted Hayride</h4>\n<p>Beware: This isn&rsquo;t your run-of-the-mill hayride. The New York Haunted Hayride, hosted on Randall&rsquo;s Island, carts brave passengers through a world of monsters, ghosts, demons, and clowns with spook-tacular backdrops and dimly lit woods. The ride is also part interactive experience, making stops at a haunted theater and dark maze. Book your tickets for Halloween night in advance <a href=\"http://newyorkhauntedhayride.com/tickets\">here</a>. <br /> </p>\n<h4>2. Merchant&rsquo;s House Museum Ghost Tour</h4>\n<p><br /> The Merchant&rsquo;s House, located in the Bowery, is said to be haunted by eight former family members who died on the premise in the late nineteenth century. Pronounced a public museum in the 1930s, guests have since reported unusual sounds, sights, and smells. On Halloween night you can take a guided candlelight tour of each eerie room and hear the tales for yourself.

Halloween Bash Yacht Party On The Hudson River</h4>\n<p>Grab your costumes and party on a yacht across the Hudson River!
