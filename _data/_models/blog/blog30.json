Park Slope offers a welcomed change of pace with its <a href=\"https://www.streetadvisor.com/6th-st-park-slope-brooklyn-new-york-city-new-york\">historic brownstones</a> set on tree-lined streets. The options are endless for a day trip in Park Slope, which borders Prospect Park, a 526-acre green space that is home to the Brooklyn Museum and Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Known as one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in America, Park Slope has a variety of dining spots, independently-owned shops and outdoor summer concert series.</p>\n<h4>Outdoors:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/\">Prospect Park</a> is the second-largest park in Brooklyn, and its size and lush greenery buffers out city sounds and provides a relaxing atmosphere. Check out the seasonal blooms, bonsai trees or fragrance garden at the <a href=\"https://www.bbg.org/\">Brooklyn Botanic Garden</a>, which boasts 52 acres of flora and fauna. Prospect Park has miles of walking paths, a lake, and the renowned <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/\">Brooklyn Museum</a>, which houses over 1.5 million art pieces ranging from ancient Egypt and Africa to 20th-century Europe. Keep in mind the museum is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1502383688588\" class=\" \" alt='grass' src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_6103/media/2017-08-09-035517/grass.jpg\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_6103/media/2017-08-09-035517/large_grass.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_6103/media/2017-08-09-035517/medium_grass.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_6103/media/2017-08-09-035517/small_grass.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_6103/media/2017-08-09-035517/xsmall_grass.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_6103/media/2017-08-09-035517/thumb_grass.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4>Food &amp; Drink:</h4>\n<p>There is no shortage of options for grabbing a bite to eat in Park Slope. We recommend <a href=\"http://stoneparkcafe.com/\">Stone Park Cafe</a>, brainchild of Park Slope locals, which serves a mean brunch (made complete with zippy bloody marys) and offers lunch and dinner.

If you&rsquo;re still on the lookout for real New York pizza, grab a slice at <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/pinos-la-forchetta/\">Pino&rsquo;s La Forchetta Pizzeria</a>, an old-school, no-frills pizza joint on 7th Ave. For day trips lasting into the evening, walk over to the Gowanus neighborhood and get cozy in <a href=\"http://luceysloungebklyn.com/index.html\">Lucey&rsquo;s Lounge</a>, a speakeasy spot that offers creative, seasonal cocktails.</p>\n<h4>Shopping:</h4>\n<p>Park Slope has a vibrant scene of vintage shops and upscale boutiques along 5th Avenue. If you&rsquo;re looking for something on the quirky side, drop by <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/habit-new-york\">Habit</a>&nbsp;for one-of-a-kind outfits and accessories. For more tailored threads, we recommend <a href=\"https://birdbrooklyn.com/\">Bird</a>, which specializes in local fashions created by local designers.

Festival</a>, with outdoor shows running through the summer at the Prospect Park Bandshell. Shows are free or fairly priced.
