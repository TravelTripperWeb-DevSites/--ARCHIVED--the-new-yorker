Travelers visiting New York City might be puzzled when hearing words like &ldquo;bodega&rdquo; and &ldquo;schmear.&rdquo; Fear not, <a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/\">The New Yorker Hotel</a>, has unraveled the mysteries of New York&rsquo;s dialect. Read on to learn how to survive some of the city&rsquo;s liguistics challenges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The City</strong></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What City? Manhattan, of course! Although New York City is made up of five boroughs - Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island - the only one that counts as a metropolis is Manhattan.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Uptown/Downtown</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next time you hop on a &ldquo;train,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll want to head North or South. In New York, that translates to &ldquo;Uptown&rdquo; (North) or Downtown (South) direction. Don&rsquo;t take it literally, though. For example, Downtown trains turn East when heading to Brooklyn.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1517865689793\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162123/new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-train.jpg\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162123/large_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-train.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162123/medium_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-train.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162123/small_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-train.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162123/xsmall_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-train.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162123/thumb_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-train.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Train</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In New York, a train is a plain old subway. No &ldquo;metro,&rdquo; no &ldquo;underground.&rdquo; Although you can take trains from Grand Central and Penn Station, it&rsquo;s hard to mistake which one you mean. &nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Houston Street</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;Houston,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s the city in the state of Texas and the street in New York. And New Yorkers like things done their own way. Next time you pronounce Houston St, think of &ldquo;house&rdquo; + &ldquo;ton.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Village</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Houston St and 14th St, and Hudson River and Sixth Ave are the boundaries of one of the most creative and eclectic neighborhoods in New York&rsquo;s history: Greenwich Village. But, New Yorkers being their practical and no-nonsense selves, abbreviate it as simply &ldquo;The Village.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">SoHo</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking of New Yorkers having better things to do with their time than pronounce long names, the chic shopping haven known as SoHo is short for South of Houston St.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Slice</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lactose intolerants, be warned: in New York&rsquo;s intricate pizza universe, a slice means one thing: a succulent, gooey cheese pizza.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1517865716687\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162152/new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-schmear.jpg\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162152/large_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-schmear.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162152/medium_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-schmear.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162152/small_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-schmear.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162152/xsmall_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-schmear.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_12018/media/2018-02-05-162152/thumb_new-yorker-hotel-10-words-you-will-only-hear-in-new-york-city-schmear.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Schmear</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A New York institution, bagels are the local favorite to-go food. Of all the possible combinations, the bagel and cream cheese combo is the most popular, however, it&rsquo;s hard to get right. You need a &ldquo;schmear&rdquo; - not too much, not too little.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Bodega</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everybody needs a late-night snack every once in a while and New Yorkers have risen up to the challenge. Located at almost any corner, small convenience stores are called &ldquo;bodegas,&rdquo; maybe in reference to the Spanish word for &ldquo;warehouse.&rdquo; These useful shops are bound to have a little bit of everything, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Fuhgedaboudit</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once again, why bother saying &ldquo;forget about it&rdquo; when a slurred &ldquo;Fuhgedaboudit&rdquo; will do? Head to genuine Italian restaurants or walk around Little Italy to catch locals using this phrase. Keep in mind that it might take a skilled ear to identify it at first.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add this New York&rsquo;s dialect survival guide to your pre-trip checklist.
