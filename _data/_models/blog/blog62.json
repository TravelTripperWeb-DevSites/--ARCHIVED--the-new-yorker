Well, not exactly. <a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/\">The New Yorker Hotel</a> happily welcomes <a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/amenities/\">cats and dogs</a>, so you can spend as much time as you want cuddling with your furry friend.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But what if you want to give your four-legged friend a tour of New York City? Public transport in New York allows pets in a carrier to travel and so do most taxi drivers. Here&rsquo;s the lowdown on everything you can do with your pet in New York.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1523497216770\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214014/new-yorker-pet-friendly-restaurant-new-york.jpg\" width=\"839\" height=\"559\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214014/large_new-yorker-pet-friendly-restaurant-new-york.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214014/medium_new-yorker-pet-friendly-restaurant-new-york.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214014/small_new-yorker-pet-friendly-restaurant-new-york.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214014/xsmall_new-yorker-pet-friendly-restaurant-new-york.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214014/thumb_new-yorker-pet-friendly-restaurant-new-york.jpg\" />Pet-Friendly Caf&eacute;s, Restaurants and Bars</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A great bonus of traveling with your pet is that you&rsquo;ll be driven to places where locals hang out with their own pets. Although these places focus on dogs, call in advance and ask if you can &nbsp;bring your cat on a leash.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/\">Shake Shack in Madison Square Garden<br /></a></strong>This is a place for humans and dogs to indulge in some comfort food-you can have a burger, hot dog or frozen custard, while your dog can munch on some dog biscuits. Late spring and summer are the best times to visit.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://barkingdog94.com/\"><strong>Barking Dog Restaurant</strong><br /></a>Have full meals or a few cocktails while your dog drinks from and plays in the watering fountains of this Upper East Side restaurant. The menu is American food with a sophisticated twist kindly provided by their chef.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.sidewalkny.com/\"><strong>Sidewalk Bar and Restaurant</strong><br /></a>You can go to Sidewalk with your friends, furry and not-so-furry. It&rsquo;s divided into a restaurant, a bar and a stage. Sit outside with your dog during daytime and come back when the sun goes down to experience East Village&rsquo;s nightlife.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"http://thebeannyc.com/\">The Bean<br /></a></strong>Dog-friendly and vegan-friendly, this caf&eacute; serves steaming tea, creamy coffee and baked goods. Easter Village is a hip neighborhood where you&rsquo;ll always find hidden gems, but this is THE neighborhood coffee shop.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1523497286551\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214124/new-yorker-travel-with-pet-to-new-york-central-parkjpg.jpg\" width=\"833\" height=\"554\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214124/large_new-yorker-travel-with-pet-to-new-york-central-parkjpg.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214124/medium_new-yorker-travel-with-pet-to-new-york-central-parkjpg.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214124/small_new-yorker-travel-with-pet-to-new-york-central-parkjpg.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214124/xsmall_new-yorker-travel-with-pet-to-new-york-central-parkjpg.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_14520/media/2018-04-11-214124/thumb_new-yorker-travel-with-pet-to-new-york-central-parkjpg.jpg\" />Parks and Dog Runs</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you want to go for a morning run or a night time stroll, New York City has parks and dog-specific areas for canine fun.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/dogs.html\">Central Park<br /></a>Make sure you bring a leash! Although most of Central Park is dog-friendly, check the <a href=\"http://assets.centralparknyc.org/pdfs/about/Dog_Owner_Guide_to_Central_Park.pdf\">Dog Owner&rsquo;s Guide</a> to find specific information about enjoying the park with your dog. Plan your visit ahead of time to know everything about off-leash hours, dog-friendly fountains, restricted areas and rules dog owners must follow (trust us, you don&rsquo;t want to be fined). &nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madison-square-park\">Madison Square Park<br /></a>A short walk from The New Yorker Hotel, Madison Square Park has a fenced Dog Run, where your dog can run free without a leash.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park\">Union Square Park <br /></a>Sine you&rsquo;re probably going to the East Village, pay a visit to nearby Union Square Park where you&rsquo;ll also find a Dog Run.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With so much to do with your pet, there&rsquo;s no reason they should be left behind.
