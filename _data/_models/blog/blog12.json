Not just anyone can whip up the greasy, down-home goodness that comes from the country&rsquo;s best diners. <a href=\"http://ticktockdinerny.com/beta2015/\">Tick Tock Diner</a> can. And we at The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel, feel pretty lucky to have this great American diner downstairs, and even luckier that it serves customers 24 hours a day. This is comfort food in all its glory. Here are some of our favorite dishes at Tick Tock Diner:</p>\n<h4>Eggs Benedict</h4>\n<p>Everyone raves about Tick Tock&rsquo;s eggs benedict. Served on a toasted English muffin, Tick Tock&rsquo;s eggs benedict comes in a variety of options. Choose from the traditional eggs benedict served with Canadian bacon and hollandaise, and a side of potato hash, or the Irish benedict, with corned beef hash. There&rsquo;s also the Texas benedict, which lets you branch out with pulled pork on brioche French toast, poached eggs and hollandaise. They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>\n<h4>Pancakes</h4>\n<p>These might be our favorite thing on the menu. Soft, fluffy, and melt-in-your mouth, these are the reason people crave diner food. Tick Tock has their pancake recipe down pat. Whether you want your pancakes with blueberries, bananas, strawberries, chocolate chips or just plain old-fashioned, this is the place to order them - all day long.</p>\n<h4>Disco Fries</h4>\n<p>These are a Tick Tock speciality. A cross between cheese fries and poutine, the Tick Tock disco fries are made with crispy, thick cut french fries and topped with warm gravy and loads of melted cheese. They&rsquo;re the perfect late night snack after a night on the town. </p>\n<h4>Mediterranean Salad</h4>\n<p>Although ordering a salad is pretty far from the first thing that comes to mind when deciding what to order at a diner, Tick Tock&rsquo;s Mediterranean salad is on point. With sundried tomatoes, arugula, romaine, grilled vegetables, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar, Tick Tock outdoes the traditional diner menu with this salad. Maybe they took a cue from their neighbors, <a href=\"http://trattoriabianca.com/\">Trattoria Blanca</a>, The New Yorker&rsquo;s Italian restaurant.</p>\n<h4>Cheeseburger Delux</h4>\n<p>Another great diner staple, Tick Tock makes a mean burger. With buttered brioche bread, grilled onions, roasted tomato, lettuce, cheese and black angus beef direct from the butcher, this burger hits the spot. So do the steak fries - thick, crispy, and piled high on the plate, this is a must for lunch or dinner. </p>"
