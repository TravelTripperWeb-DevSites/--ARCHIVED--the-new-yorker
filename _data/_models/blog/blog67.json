Check out these incredible attractions that are bound to be the highlight of your trip.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.intrepidmuseum.org/\">Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum </a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From May 25 to August 24, the ship&rsquo;s flight deck will become a free outdoor movie theater featuring a series of six movies, including Top Gun and Dunkirk. Doors close at 8:30pm but you need to arrive a couple of hours in advance. To pass the time while the movie begins, join one of the guided tours of the Space Shuttle Pavilion, the submarine Growler or the Concorde; or simply enjoy the amazing views of the Hudson River.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1526918469336\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120059/new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy.png\" alt=\"new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120059/large_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120059/medium_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120059/small_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120059/xsmall_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120059/thumb_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-governors-islandy.png\" /><a href=\"https://govisland.com/\">Governors Island</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard of a small island located between Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan that&rsquo;s a haven for those looking to unplug from the bustling city. Governor&rsquo;s Island is open from May 1 to October 31 from 10am to 6pm on weekdays and 10am to 7pm on weekends. Car-free biking, running, ziplining and sports are only a handful of the activities you can practice there. What&rsquo;s more, this summer the Film Society of Lincoln Center will screen a New York-themed movie per month, from June to September. New York&rsquo;s backyard is just a ferry ride away! </p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://natgeoencounter.com/\">National Geographic Encounter Ocean Odyssey</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As one of the newest attractions in the city, National Geographic Encounter: Ocean Odyssey should be in your summer bucket list. This is a journey that merges state-of-the-art technology and special effects with ocean exploration to create a digital and interactive underwater world. This attraction is guaranteed to appeal to adults, teens and children of all ages.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1526918524843\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120153/new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park.png\" alt=\"new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120153/large_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120153/medium_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120153/small_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120153/xsmall_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_15967/media/2018-05-21-120153/thumb_new-yorker-5-summer-attractions-in-nyc-to-visit-your-famil-central-park.png\" /><a href=\"https://centralparkzoo.com/\">Central Park Zoo</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing beats strolling around Central Park Zoo on a perfect summer day. Apart from having the chance of seeing species from all over the world up close, the zoo has more than animal exhibits. A 4-D Theater features fun films appropriate for children aged 6 and upwards, while toddlers can spend their day at the Tisch Children&rsquo;s Zoo petting and learning about farm animals. &nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.nybg.org/\">New York Botanical Garden</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the sun is out, dozens upon dozens of species bloom and decorate the garden with every color, shape and size you could imagine. What&rsquo;s more, NYBG organizes weekend summer programs that you can&rsquo;t miss. Our favorite this year is Aloha Nights (select Saturdays from June 9 to August 18) and Hawai&lsquo;i Weekends (select weekends from May 19 to August 19). Complement your visit to the current exhibit of Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Visions of Hawai&rsquo;i&rdquo; with Hawaiian-themed events, such as live music, performances, art demonstrations and cocktails.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you want an unforgettable experience in the city? Book your room at the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/\">New Yorker Hotel </a>and enjoy staying at<a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/about/\"> the most iconic hotel in NYC</a>.</p>",
