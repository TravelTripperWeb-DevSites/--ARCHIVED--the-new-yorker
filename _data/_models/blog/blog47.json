Guests fill surrounding streets and hotels to snag a view of the drop, celebrating with live entertainment, large balloons, confetti, and hats. This year, once the the ball drops and guests kiss a loved one, The Mermaid from Futurama will kick off the party by singing &nbsp;&ldquo;Imagine&rdquo; by John Lennon, followed by fireworks. Through a city partnership with Chongqing, China, the celebration will also include a performance by the Tongliang Athletics Dragon Dance. This human-dragon dance boasts rapid movements, speedy transitions, and impressive choreography. Be sure to show up early (12pm!) to snag a spot in the street. If you prefer a less-crowded celebration, we suggest heading over to the <a href=\"https://www.balldrop.com/new-years-eve-amc-42-times-square\">AMC 42nd Street Theater</a> to catch a view of the ball from their terrace then watch blockbuster movies or dance all night long! A premium bar and movie snacks will be available for purchase. And if you want to bring the kids along, there's also a separate alcohol-free party full of movies, party favors, and more.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1513721390948\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_10410/media/2017-12-19-165608/NYC-New-Years-Eve-Prospect-Park-Fireworks.jpg\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_10410/media/2017-12-19-165608/large_NYC-New-Years-Eve-Prospect-Park-Fireworks.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_10410/media/2017-12-19-165608/medium_NYC-New-Years-Eve-Prospect-Park-Fireworks.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_10410/media/2017-12-19-165608/small_NYC-New-Years-Eve-Prospect-Park-Fireworks.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_10410/media/2017-12-19-165608/xsmall_NYC-New-Years-Eve-Prospect-Park-Fireworks.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_10410/media/2017-12-19-165608/thumb_NYC-New-Years-Eve-Prospect-Park-Fireworks.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Fireworks In Prospect Park</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5e3d94d4-70d9-1378-fab4-3a9d03252913\">Come midnight on January 1st, the Prospect Park Alliance and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams will launch <a href=\"https://www.prospectpark.org/news-events/events/2016/12/31\">free fireworks</a>, visible from Grand Army Plaza, the Park&rsquo;s West Drive, and along Prospect Park West between Grand Army Plaza and 9th Street.
