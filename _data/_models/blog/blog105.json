How did <a href=\"http://thecitybakery.com/\">City Bakery</a> come to be? Founded in 1990 by Maury Rubin, a true lover of everything related to baking, City Bakery quickly became a neighborhood staple. Today, it has evolved into a world-famous brand that has been featured, along with Rubin, in The New York Times, The New Yorker Magazine, New York Magazine, Food &amp; Wine Magazine and The Los Angeles Times.</p>\n<h4>About the City Bakery Annual Hot Chocolate Festival</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we said earlier, it takes place every February. A very cunning move, as February is one of the coldest months of the year &mdash; and who doesn&rsquo;t crave a creamy, decadent, hot drink on a frigid day? Each day of the month presents a new artisan flavor that is only served that day. Some people even make a challenge of trying every single one, even if that means risking a chocolate comma! Traditionally, by the end of the month, the combinations become more unique and extravagant, but remain as delicious as ever.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1549478129803\" class=\" \" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1549478098/aekvlqxz5fe2cr63exbi.jpg\" alt=\"woman-holding-a-mug-of-hot-chocolate-with-marshmallows\" data-image-large=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1549478098/aekvlqxz5fe2cr63exbi.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1549478098/aekvlqxz5fe2cr63exbi.jpg\" data-image-small=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1549478098/aekvlqxz5fe2cr63exbi.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1549478098/aekvlqxz5fe2cr63exbi.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1549478098/aekvlqxz5fe2cr63exbi.jpg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 2019 selection will include Lemon Hot Chocolate, Creamy Stout Hot Chocolate, Pear-Skin Infused White Chocolate, S-Morey Hot Chocolate, French Follies Hot Chocolate, Bourbon Hot Chocolate, Mystics Milk Hot Chocolate and more.
