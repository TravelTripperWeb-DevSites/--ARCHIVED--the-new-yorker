And on National Pizza Day, it\u0026rsquo;s a must. After all, Americans\u0026rsquo; love of pizza did originate in the Big Apple. And to this day, no one does it better than New York with its thin and crispy crust. That said, here are our favorite places for pizza in Manhattan:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrattoria Bianca\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel\u003cbr /\u003e481 8th Avenue\u003cbr /\u003eNew York, NY 10001\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe white pizza at \u003ca href=\"http://trattoriabianca.com/\"\u003eTrattoria Bianca\u003c/a\u003e just might be our favorite thing on the entire menu. Topped with prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella-melted onions, and drizzled with olive oil, the Bianco comes out crispy. Naturally, we\u0026rsquo;re a little partial to Trattoria Bianca, considering it\u0026rsquo;s located inside The New Yorker. But can you really argue with great pizza just steps away from your hotel room? We can\u0026rsquo;t. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLombardi\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e32 Spring Street\u003cbr /\u003eNew York, NY 10012 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen you think pizza in Little Italy, you think \u003ca href=\"http://www.firstpizza.com/\"\u003eLombardi\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e. Opened in 1905, Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s was the first pizzeria in the United States. And today, it\u0026rsquo;s that good that it\u0026rsquo;s still in business. Known for it\u0026rsquo;s brick oven, Neapolitan-style pizza, Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s crust is a bit thicker - crispy on the outside, soft, even chewy on the inside, with slabs of cheese and meat. It\u0026rsquo;s not a national landmark, but it should be. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJohn\u0026rsquo;s of Times Square\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e260 W 44th Street\u003cbr /\u003eNew York, NY 10036 \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen you want a classic, just-plain-good New York pie, go to \u003ca href=\"http://www.johnspizzerianyc.com/\"\u003eJohn\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/a\u003e. Baked in coal-fired ovens, this the self-proclaimed \u0026ldquo;most unique pizza\u0026rdquo; in New York isn\u0026rsquo;t unique for some strange combination of toppings, or some gluten-free crust,\u0026nbsp; it\u0026rsquo;s unique for its homemade flavor in the heart of a chain-ridden Times Square. The fact that it\u0026rsquo;s located inside an old church might have something to do with that as well. Order the garlic rolls, too. You won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEataly\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e200 5th Avenue\u003cbr /\u003eNew York, NY 10010\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAlthough Eataly might not have as much history as some of the other restaurants on this list, it\u0026rsquo;s made quite the name for itself in the past few years, in part due to it\u0026rsquo;s big-name owner Mario Batali. Conceptualized as\u0026nbsp; one big Italian market, Eataly is not only\u0026nbsp; New Yorkers\u0026rsquo; go-to for Italian grocery, it\u0026rsquo;s also the home of some great restaurants - like \u003ca href=\"https://www.eataly.com/us_en/stores/chicago/chicago-la-pizza-la-pasta/\"\u003eLa Pizza and La Pasta\u003c/a\u003e.

After all, eating Grimaldi\u0026rsquo;s under the Brooklyn Bridge is one of those authentic New York experiences that you have to live. It\u0026rsquo;s also one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get old, no matter how many times you do it. However, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to venture all the way to Brooklyn, there is a location in Chelsea, that\u0026rsquo;s just as delicious.\u003c/p\u003e","short_description":"\u003cp\u003eEating pizza is a New York tradition.
