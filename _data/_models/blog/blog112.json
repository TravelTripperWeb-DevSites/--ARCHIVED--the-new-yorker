Next, make sure you book a room at The New Yorker Hotel. Why? Because <a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">baseball players and The New Yorker Hotel</a> go way back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1941, the Brooklyn Dodgers all stayed at The New Yorker Hotel during their face-off with the New York Yankees for the 1941 World Series, popularly regarded as the beginning of the &ldquo;Subway Series&rdquo; between the two New York teams. Unfortunately, the Dodgers ended up losing the series after five games.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In August 21, 1945, Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb met at The New Yorker Hotel to make plans for the &ldquo;All American Boys&rsquo; Baseball Game&rdquo; to be played on the Polo Grounds on August 28, 1945. A few years later, Joe DiMaggio and Frank Robinson attended the 1967 New Yorker Hotel Sports Fair. Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays attended the same fair in 1968.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1553817798630\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553817779/g06g8j9toduoufatojko.jpg\" alt=\"photo-of-gate-4-facade-of-yankee-stadium\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1553817779/g06g8j9toduoufatojko.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1553817779/g06g8j9toduoufatojko.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1553817779/g06g8j9toduoufatojko.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1553817779/g06g8j9toduoufatojko.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1553817779/g06g8j9toduoufatojko.jpg\" />Yankee Stadium</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong><a href=\"http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/mass_transit.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Directions to Yankee Stadium</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>Yankee Stadium offers plenty to do before or after a game, so plan on spending a few extra hours there.
