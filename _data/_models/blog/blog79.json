Red leather seats and wooden paneling decorate the interior, while the great deck outside catches most the attention. They have a generous seating area to while away those summer days along with a big screen and good American food.</p>\n<p><a title=\"City Vineyard\" href=\"https://cityvineyardnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City Vineyard</a></p>\n<p><em>233 West Street, New York, NY 10013</em></p>\n<p>Perfect for any occasion, City Vineyard has two outdoor areas. A roof deck or a wine garden with grapevines adorning the upstairs to create a vineyard feel. A great option if you have spent the day exploring, but feel the need to escape the city.
