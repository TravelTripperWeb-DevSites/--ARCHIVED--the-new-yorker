The answer is the <a href=\"https://nycwff.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York City Wine &amp; Food Festival</a>, a four-day event that combines the very best cuisine and spirits with a collective desire to end hunger. It will be held on October 11-14 in venues across the city and tickets are selling like hot bread. The good news is that all proceeds go to charities committed to eradicating hunger.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1536867373151\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_18955/media/2018-09-13-153535/large_new-yorker-food-wine-festival-2018-dinner.png\" alt=\"chef-decorating-plate-of-gourmet-food\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_18955/media/2018-09-13-153535/large_new-yorker-food-wine-festival-2018-dinner.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_18955/media/2018-09-13-153535/medium_new-yorker-food-wine-festival-2018-dinner.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_18955/media/2018-09-13-153535/small_new-yorker-food-wine-festival-2018-dinner.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_18955/media/2018-09-13-153535/xsmall_new-yorker-food-wine-festival-2018-dinner.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/426_558_18955/media/2018-09-13-153535/thumb_new-yorker-food-wine-festival-2018-dinner.png\" />Food</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given that the core of the festival is the food, any event that you attend will be more than worth your while.

This event can be as inexpensive or as expensive as you want. You can choose many events from under $100 admission per person (sometimes a lot less than that!) or individual tickets can go up to $300 or more. If you&rsquo;re planning to attend several events, you should consider purchasing a package. For example, a <strong>Party Animal Package</strong> costs $390 but includes a ticket to three major events.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And that&rsquo;s New York City Food &amp; Wine Festival in a nutshell.
