Now that you know exactly where it is, have you ever wondered where the name Herald Square come from? You might be surprised to learn that it got its name from The New York Herald, a newspaper that ran from the mid 19th Century to the 60s. It was founded by James Gordon Bennett in 1835 and focused on sensational stories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But the arrival of Macy&rsquo;s is what sealed this neighborhood&rsquo;s fate. Back in 1858, Rowland Hussey Macy opened a dry goods store at the corner of 14th Street and 6th Avenue. In 1902, the successful retailer moved to its current home in Herald Square and changed its surroundings forever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to read more about the days of old, explore <a href=\"http://newyorkerhotel.com/history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New Yorker Hotel&rsquo;s timeline</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/blog/category/the-new-yorker-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">history blog posts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1576168763040\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1576168743/g6eofk56y1kq83svcez7.jpg\" alt=\"Angled facade of Macy's and Empire State Building. \" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1576168743/g6eofk56y1kq83svcez7.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1576168743/g6eofk56y1kq83svcez7.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1576168743/g6eofk56y1kq83svcez7.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1576168743/g6eofk56y1kq83svcez7.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1576168743/g6eofk56y1kq83svcez7.jpg\" />Herald Square Today</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fast forwarding to the 21st Century, Herald Square is one of New York&rsquo;s busiest neighborhoods and business hubs.
